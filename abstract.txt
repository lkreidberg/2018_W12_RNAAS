An exosphere was recently detected around the exoplanet WASP-107b, a
low-density, warm Neptune, based on an absorption feature from metastable helium
(which has a vacuum wavelength of $10833\,\mathrm{\AA}$).  Inspired by the
WASP-107b detection, we reanalyzed archival HST observations of another
evaporating exoplanet, WASP-12b, to search for signs of helium in the exosphere.
We find no significant increase in transit depth at $10833\,\mathrm{\AA}$. We
compare this result to theoretical predictions from a 1D model, and find that
the expected helium feature amplitude is small, in agreement with the
non-detection.  We discuss possible explanations for why the helium feature is weaker for WASP-12b than WASP-107b, and conclude that the amplitude of the signal is highly sensitive to the stellar spectrum and the geometry of the evaporating gas cloud.  These considerations should be taken into account in the design of future searches for helium exospheres.
